# *Clostridioides difficile* Toxins Unhinged: Allosterically Switchable Network Orients Beta-flap

## Description
Allosteric proteins regulate function by substrate binding far from the active site. 
*Clostridioides difficile* toxins use allosteric binding by an endogenous co-factor to orchestrate self-cleavage from within the target cell. 
This binding event induces a conformational shift, primarily effecting a lever-like "beta-flap" region, with two known orientations. 
We uncovered a mechanism for this allosteric transition using extensive atomistic MD simulations and computational and experimental mutagenesis.
The mechanism relies on a switchable interaction network. 
The most prominent interaction is K600â€“E743, with K600 interactions explaining ~70 % of the allosteric effect.
Rather than gradually morphing between two end states, the interaction network adopts two mutually exclusive configurations in the active and inactive state.
Similar switchable networks may explain allostery more broadly.
This mechanism in particular could aid in drug development targeting the *Clostridioides difficile* toxins autoproteolysis.

### Conformation naming
The names given to conformations changed during the development 
of this project. The conformation named "closed" corresponds to the
lowered conformation, while the name "open" corresponds to the 
"raised" conformation.

### Residue numbering
Throughout the paper, residues are numbered based on full-toxin numbering. Residue numbering in the scripts is indexed from the first modelled residue. To convert to full-toxin numbering, add 543 for TcdB and add 541 for TcdA. In particular, K57 -> K600 and E200 -> E743.
